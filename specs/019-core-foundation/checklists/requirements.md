# Specification Quality Checklist: P1 — Core Foundation & Ecosystem Harmonization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-10-05  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs in user stories)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 7 user stories (Q3, Q2, Q4, F3, F4, F7, CI) are fully specified with testable acceptance criteria.
- Zero `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers exist as all technical requirements, priority order, and scope bounds were directly provided and confirmed in the baseline.
- Specification is 100% ready for `/speckit-plan`.
